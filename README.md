Random demos in JavaScript.

[Here](http://totient.github.io/js-demos/monte_carlo.html) is the demo of [Monte Carlo algorithm](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm) to find the area using pseudo-&pi;. This page also facilitates the comparison of both areas, the one using &pi; and pseudo-&pi;.

[Here](http://totient.github.io/js-demos/primality_test.html) is the demo of primality test using [Trial Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division) and [Fermat Little Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_little_theorem), and a graph comparison of number of steps needed for both.
